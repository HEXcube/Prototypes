Prototypes
==========
UI Prototypes, App Mockups, Wireframes, Previews and other art assets for the
projects I work on.

### HOW TO USE
I do my mockups in SVG format with [Inkscape][inkscape] vector graphics editor.
For editing raster images, I use [GIMP][gimp]. So, if you wanna edit any of my
artworks, you'll most likely need the same tools too.

Watch the [timelapse videos][timelapse] by [Cameron "Skypher" Bohnstedt][skypher]
to get an idea about how artists use tools like [Inkscape][inkscape] and
[GIMP][gimp] to create artwork. Here are some of the designers and their design
concepts from which I got inspiration. Maybe they'll inspire you too!
